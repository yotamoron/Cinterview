For our new high performance distributed calculator, we have formulated the 
following protocol:

- Client → Server (handshake):
    - “START_TRANSACTION [SECURED|SEPARATE|SCRAP]”
      The client is asking the server to start a transaction, with one of 
      the three modes:
      - SECURED:
        Encrypt any data on the server side
      - SEPARATE:
        Save this transaction’s details in a separate file
      - SCRAP:
        Scrap any info that have been saved during the transaction
    - START_TRANSACTION and the desired mode are always one space separated
    - An example: “START_TRANSACTION SCRAP”
- Server → Client (handshake):
    - “[SECURED|SEPARATE|SCRAP]”
      The server sends back the mode that the client asked
    - An example: “SEPARATE”
- Client → Server (Operator and arguments):
    Next the client sends to the server the operator that needs to be 
    applied and the arguments.
    The operator is one of: “[PLUS|MINUS|TIMES|DIVIDE]”
    The arguments are always 2 positive numbers, between 0-65535 (including 
    0 and 65535).
    The operator and the numbers are each exactly one space separated
    - An example: “PLUS 4325 983”
- Server → Client (Operator and arguments):
  The server makes the needed calculations, and returns an answer to the 
  client.
    - The answer is always prefixed by the string “RESULT”, with the 
      actual result following
    - The result is always a round number between 0-65535 (including), 
      OR the string “ERROR” is the result couldn’t have been calculated 
      (division by zero for example) or is bigger than 65535/smaller than 0
    - The string RESULT and the actual result are always exactly one space 
      separated
- Client → Server (Teardown):
    - The client sends the string “OK CLOSE” to the server
- Server → Client (Teardown):
    - The server sends the string “CLOSED” to the client and concludes the 
      transaction.
- Each and every request/response MUST have a suffix “ VON_NEUMANN” (note 
  the space before the 'V')

  
Your job: 

Write a verification plugin!
============================

Your plugin will have a lifecycle: INIT -> VERIFY -> CLOSE.
The server will:
1. Call an INIT function once, to create and initialize the plugin instance.
2. Call a VERIFY function zero or more times, to process lines/packets of the
   protocol detailed above.
3. Finally, invoke a CLOSE function in order to clean up and shutdown the plugin
   instance.

Each stage in the lifecycle will be represented by a function, as detailed 
below.

1. init():
  Your plugin will have an init() function that will be called by the server. 
  The init() signature is:

  /* 
   * Prototype of the function that will initialize the private data before 
   * starting the verification process
   */
  typedef void *(*verification_plugin_init_t)();

  The init() function will be called once in order to create the calculator 
  backend, and is expected to return a pointer 'priv_data', which will be 
  returned on every call to the 'verify' and 'close' functions.

2. verify_packet():
  For the verification stage, the plugin will contain a function for verifying
  a packet (as detailed above). The Server promises to call this function
  with complete lines/packets. Of course, packets are all null-terminated 
  strings. The packet data may NOT be changed by this function.
  The function will return a value of the type 'verification_result_t'.

  typedef enum {
      /* Packet has been verified */
      verification_result_ok = 0,

      /* There’s a space issue somewhere */
      verification_result_space = 1,

      /* A number is smaller than 0 or bigger than 65535 */
      verification_result_overflow = 2,

      /* A packet’s suffix missing or corrupted */
      verification_result_bad_suffix = 3,
		
      /* ... Any more ? ... */
		
      verification_result_max
		
  } verification_result_t;

  typedef verification_result_t (*verification_plugin_verify_packet_t)(char *packet, void *priv_data);

Upon faulty packet, the entire flow is terminated and the next packet arriving
to the verification plugin would be of a new flow.

3. close():

  For the shutdown stage, a function with the following signature will be 
  declared:

  typedef void (*verification_plugin_close_t)(void *priv_data);

  This function must perform all cleanup operations.

plugin module:
==============

The module may only export a single global variable - 'my_plugin' - 
referencing the plugin structure, of the type:

  typedef struct verification_plugin_t {
      char                                *plugin_name;
      verification_plugin_init_t          init;
      verification_plugin_verify_packet_t verify;
      verification_plugin_close_t         close;
  } verification_plugin_t;


----------------------------

You goals:
- 100% accuracy. The test run will terminate if the verification process 
  return an incorrect result (i.e. false positive/negative).
- The code must run under 1 second on the designated input, on the test machine.
- The verification process MUST NOT change the content of any non-private input
- Clean code will make the interviewer very happy.
